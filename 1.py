You need to analyze each passages to understand what they are talking about and analyze the query to learn what types of passage is more relevant. Then you need to output the reranked order based on your analyze. Your format should be:\n            - Query: <analyzing>\n            - passgase[i] <analyzing>\n            - raw anwser <your output order>\n            2) After that, you must conduct multi-round pairwise comparisons BETWEEN passages as needed to derive a reliable order. In each round, you can do many comparisons as you need. After each round, you need to output the current order.:\n               - Comparison line: \"Compare [i] vs [j]: [i|j] is more relevant because <brief reason>\"\n               - order line:\"[i] > [j] > [k]> ....\"(full order)\n               Guidance for <think>:\n               - You do NOT need to compare every pair; you just need to do comparisons to make the order more reasonable\n               - Keep reasons concise and focused on query relevance\n\n            3) Then, you need to do a final check, refine the final order as needed and make sure the end order contains all passages without duplication \n\n            4) In the end , within <answer> tags, output ONLY the final ranking in descending order of relevance using the exact format:\n               [X] > [Y] > [Z] > ... (include ALL identifiers exactly once, no omissions, no duplicates)\n               Do NOT include any extra text besides the chain inside <answer>.\n            IMPORTANT: You must strictly follow the <think> and <answer>format
